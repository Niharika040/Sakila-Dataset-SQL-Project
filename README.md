# Sakila-Dataset-SQL-Project

##  Description
This project demonstrates  SQL concepts and techniques using the Sakila database, a sample database designed for learning and testing SQL queries. The project includes exploratory analysis, complex queries, stored procedures, CTEs, window functions, and optimization techniques.

## Features
1. **Exploratory Analysis**: Understanding the schema, data distribution, and relationships in the Sakila dataset.
2. **Advanced Queries**:
   - Top customers by total payments.
   - Active rentals with customer and film details.
   - Revenue analysis by year.
3. **Window Functions**: Rank actors by the number of films they've acted in.
4. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Revenue breakdown by year.
5. **Stored Procedures**: Automating queries for actor revenue analysis.
6. **Query Optimization**: Indexing and analyzing query execution plans for performance improvements.
